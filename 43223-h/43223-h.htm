<h3>THE OLD CASE OF POETRY<br />IN A NEW COURT.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><b>BY FRANCIS BARTON GUMMERE.</b></p>

<p class="indent">Although hailed as queen of the arts
and hedged about by a kind of divinity, Poetry seems
to sit on an always tottering throne. In nearly
every age known to human records, some one has
chronicled his forebodings that the days of Poetry
were numbered; and again the critic, or the
Poet himself, has plucked up his courage and
uttered a fairly hopeful defence. Yet even this
hope has been absent from periods which now
seem poetic in the highest degree. Michael Drayton
could find scant consolation for his art,
dedicating certain poems to gentlemen who "in
these declining times.... love and cherish neglected
poesy." The enemies of poetry are always
alert, and often come disguised as friends.
When, at the end of the Middle Ages, moralists
ceased to attack the poets, there appeared the
man of science, a far more formidable person;
and, under cover of the dust and smoke in strong
battle waged between these open foes, poetry
has been spoiled of one cherished possession after
another at the hands of a professedly ardent
ally. Horace Walpole's alternative neatly implied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
the whole question under debate: "Poetry,"
he complained, "is gone to bed, or into our
prose,"&mdash;an odd speech for one who helped to ring
the romantic rising-bell. Bulwer, writing ponderously
"On Certain Principles of Art in
Works of the Imagination," was sure that
Prose had come to be the only medium of
artistic narrative. Malicious people point even
now to a language which never had any prose,
and yet has lost its splendid heritage of verse:
barring Grillparzer, silent long before his death,
Germany has not seen a poet for the last fifty
years. But, answers the optimist, who knows
what <i>ambulando</i> argument for poetry is not now
preparing somewhere in the fatherland? And as
for Bulwer, his ink was hardly dry when Tennyson
began those charming and miscalled Idylls of
the King. If epic poetry seems dead just now, it
seemed quite as dead four hundred years ago in
France. So this harmless war is waged. What
comes of it all? What has been done? What
progress? Other causes come up, find a hearing
on the evidence, get a verdict more or less in
agreement with facts, and go upon record; this
case lies hopeless in chancery. Why must it
wait there, along with all the old metaphysical
questions, for a decision that never can be handed
down? If one may do nothing else, one may at
least take the case to a different court, demand
fresh evidence, and appeal to another code of laws.</p>

<p class="indent">Before all things, it behooves both parties to
this argument to come at the facts in the case.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Barring a threat or so of historical
treatment, as in Macaulay's famous essay on Milton,
writers who handle this matter of the decline of poetry
invariably pass either into critical discussion of
more or less value in itself, or else into amiable
hysterics. To speak brutal truth, hysterics are
preferred, and little else is recognized. It is all
very well to say that the study of poetry has been
put on a scientific basis; the mass of readers
who are interested in poetry, the mass of reviewers,&mdash;and
one finds this true in quite unexpected
quarters,&mdash;care for no scientific basis at
all. In other words, they exclude from their
study of poetry a good half of the facts of poetry.</p>

<p class="indent">In any living science one begins by
finding and grouping all the facts, high and low alike;
and one then proceeds to establish the relations of
these facts on lines of record and comparison.
The facts of poetry should be conterminous with
the whole range of poetic material; and when one
faces this material, one has to do with an element
in human life, although the ordinary writer
seems to think that he degrades his subject by
taking such an attitude. He searches for the
cause and fact of poetry in a sphere outside of
human life, removed from ordinary human conditions,
and touching only an infinitesimal part
of the sum of poetic material. True, there is
nothing nobler than the effort to reckon with
great poetry, and competent critics who succeed in
this must always hold a conspicuous place in letters;
but great poetry and the great critic are not
all. Poetry, high or low, as product of a human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
impulse and as a constant element in the life of
man, belongs to that history which has been defined
of late as "concrete sociology"&mdash;the study
of human society itself; and it is on this ground,
and not in criticism, that the question of the decline
of poetry must be asked and answered.</p>

<p class="indent">The task of poetics, as yet almost untried,
is to make clear the relations between higher and lower
forms. Like war, marriage, worship, magic, personal
adornment, and a dozen other institutions
of this sort, poetry is an element in human life
which seems to go back to the beginnings of society.
Trustworthy writers even say it was one
of the more conspicuous factors in the making of
society; and when one is asked whether poetry,
that is, emotional rhythmic utterances, must be
regarded as a decreasing factor in contemporary
social progress, one faces a question of sociological
as well as of literary interest, and one
must answer it on broader ground than biographical
criticism, in clearer terms than can be furnished
by those old hysterics about genius. To
treat the question as it is almost invariably
treated, to make it an ingenious speculation
whether any more great poets can arise under our
modern conditions, whether Goethe, if he were
born now, would not be simply a great naturalist,
and whether Robert Browning or Huxley better
solved the riddle of the painful earth,&mdash;all this
is to keep up an unwholesome separation of poetics
from vital and moving sciences, and to make
the discussion itself mere chatter.</p>

<p class="indent">The advantage in this sociological study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
poetry is that it can keep abreast of other
sciences. The oars dip into actual water, the boat
moves, whether with the current of opinion or
against it, and the landscape changes for one's
pains; anything is better than the old rowing-machines,
or rather than the theatrical imitation
of a boat, with the sliding scenery and the spectators
that pay to be fooled. Moreover, it is
wide scientific work, not laboratory methods, so
called, like countings of words, curves of expression,
and all such pleasant devices that rarely
mount above the mechanical in method and the
wholly external in results; in sociological poetics
one is dealing with the life of the race and with
the heart of man. F. Schlegel's famous word
about art in general holds firm here; the science
of poetry is the history of poetry, history in its
widest and deepest sense. The futile character
of poetic studies springs from that fatal ease
with which a powerful thinker sets down thoughts
about poetry, and from the reluctance to under-take
such hard work as confronts even our powerful
thinker when he is minded to know the facts.
To get the wide outlook, one must climb; to get
the deep insight, one must analyze and order and
compare. Now the pity of it is that this outlook
and this insight, this appreciation of a masterpiece
and this knowledge of the vast material of
which it is part, are not only rarely achieved in
themselves, but are seldom if ever united. The
great poems are studied apart; and as a group,
more or less stable, they form what is known as
poetry. Detached from the mass of verse, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
from the social medium where all poetry begins
and grows, they are referred to those conditions of
genius which can tell at best but half the tale;
while that very mass of verse which one concedes
to the social group, that unregarded rhythmic utterance
of field and festival in which communal
emotion&mdash;the agitating joys and sorrows of the
common people&mdash;found and still finds vent, is left
as a fad of ethnologists and folk-lore societies.
But the material thus divided belongs together;
each half should explain the other half; and such
an unscientific rejection of material must take
poetics hopelessly out of the running.</p>

<p class="indent">This plea for a more comprehensive range
of material holds good not only in the discussion of
poetry in general, its origins, history, future, but
in the study of the great poem itself. Take something
that every one reads, and even Macaulay's
schoolboy studies&mdash;the Lycidas of Milton. Reader,
critic, biographer, have long since come to terms
with the poem; it stirs heart and mind, it belongs
to the masterpieces, it voices the genius of Milton,
it echoes Puritan England. Here one usually
stops; but here one should not stop. Lycidas, as
a poem, is the outcome of human emotion in long
reaches of social progress; it is primarily a poem
of grief for the dead, a link in that chain of evolution
in rhythmic utterance which leads from wild
gestures and inarticulate cries up to the stately
march of Milton's verse and the higher mood of his
thought. So far from degrading one's conception
of great poetry, the comparison of rough communal
verse should throw into strongest relief the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
dignity and the majesty of a poet's art. One has
taken this poet from his parochial limits, and
set him strongly lighted, at the front of a great
stage, with its dim background full of half-seen,
strangely moving figures; his song is now detached
from a vast chorus of human lamentation, and
now sinks back into it as into its source. In certain
great elegies, as also in the hymeneal, this
chorus actually lingers as a refrain. True, the individuals
of the chorus are seldom interesting in
themselves. The black fellow of Australia shall
not soothe our grief with his howlings for his dead,
nor even the Corsican widow with her <i>vocero</i>.
But the chorus as chorus is impressive enough;
it is a part of the piece; heard or unheard, it belongs
with the triumphs of individual art. Somewhere
in every great poem lurks this legacy of communal
song. It may better be called the silent
partner, without whose capital, at the least, no
poet can now trade in Parnassian ware; and as
for lyric verse, there the partner is not even silent.
All amorous lyric, whether of German Walther or
of Roman Catullus, holds an echo of festal throngs
singing and dancing at the May. The troubadours
come down to us with proud names, yet they
are only spokesmen of an aristocratic guild; and
this again was but a sifting and a refinement of
the throngs which danced about their <i>regine Avrillouse</i>
a thousand years ago. It was once lad and
lass in the crowd; it comes to be lover and high-born
dame at daybreak, with a warning from the
watcher on the castle walls; then that vogue
passes, with all its songs that seem to sing themselves;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
the situation has grown deplorably unconventional,
and the note is false. Amorous lyric
waxes mere grave, taking on a new privacy of utterance,
and a new individuality of tone. It is
now the subtle turn of thought, and not the cadence
of festal passion, which sets off Lovelace's
one perfect song from all its kind; yet, without
that throb of passion, that rhythm as of harmonious
steps, one of them a piece of human nature,
and the other a legacy from the throng, Lovelace
had never made his verses and there would be
no lyric in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Poetry is thus a genesis in the throng, then an
exodus with the solitary poet, then&mdash;though this
is too often forgotten&mdash;a return to the throng.
At least it is so with the great poets. Not the
poet, but the verse-smith, the poetaster, is anxious
to deny his parentage in communal song, and to
set for his excellent differences. He will daze the
editor and force his way into the magazine by
tricks of expression, a new adjective, a shock of
strange collocations. In a steamboat on the Baltic
I once met a confidential soul who told me of
his baffled designs upon the vogue of modern fiction.
He had written, it seemed, a novel without a
woman in it; and he had printed this novel in red
ink. "And I am not famous yet," he sighed. So
with one kind of minor poet. He works through
eccentricities and red ink. He is like Jean Paul's
army chaplain Schmelzle, who, when a boy in
church, was so often tempted to rise and cry
aloud, "Here am I, too, Mr. Parson!" It is not
so with the great poets, not so even with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
poets whom one may not call great, but who
know how to touch the popular heart. All the
masters, Homer, Shakespeare, Goethe, even Dante,
win their greatest triumphs by coming back to simplicity
in form and diction as to the source of all
poetic expression. Or, to put it more scientifically,
in any masterpiece one will find the union of
individual genius with that harmony of voices
and sympathy of hearts achieved by long ages of
poetic evolution working in the social mass.</p>

<p class="indent">If such a range of poetic material is
needed even in criticism, how strictly must it be demanded
in any question about the art as a whole! One may
turn from history to prophecy; but poetry must
still be studied even more rigidly in its full range
and with regard to all human elements in the case.
Because the communal elements, once so plain
and insistent, now elude all but the most searching
gaze, that is no reason for leaving them out of the
account. Hennequin saw that simply for critical
purposes one must reckon not only with the maker
of poetry, but with the consumer as well; and the
student of poetry at large must go still farther. It
is after all only a remnant who choose and enjoy
great poetry, just as it is only a remnant who follow
righteousness in private life and probity in
civic standards.</p>

<p class="indent">But what of the cakes and ale? What of
the uncritical folk? What stands now, since people
have come indoors, for the old ring of dancers, the
old songs of May and Harvest Home? Does the
lapse of these mean a lapse in poetry at large?
Or what has taken their place? How shall one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
dispose of the room over a village store, the hot
stove, the folk in Sunday dress, and the young
woman who draws tears down the very grocer's
cheek as she "renders" Curfew Shall Not Ring
To-Night? What of the never-ending crop of songs
in street and concert-hall, and on the football
field, verses that still time the movements of labor
and the steps of a marching crowd? What of
homely, comfortable poetry, too, commonplace perhaps,
but dear to declaiming youth? Only a staff
cut from Sophoclean timber will support your
lonely dreamer as he makes his way over the marl;
but the common citizen, who does most of the
world's work, and who has more to do with the
future of poetry than a critic will concede, finds
his account in certain smooth, didactic, and
mainly cheerful verses which appear in the syndicate
newspapers, and will never attain a magazine
or an anthology. If singing throngs keep
rhythm alive, it is this sort of poets that must both
make and mend the paths of genius. Commonplace
is a poor word. Horace gives one nothing
else; but a legion of critics shall not keep us from
Horace, and even Matthew Arnold, critic as he
was, fell back for his favorite poem on that seventh
ode of the fourth book,&mdash;as arrant commonplace
as Gray's Elegy itself. Members of a Browning
society have been known to descend earthward by
reading Longfellow. If minor poets and obvious,
popular poems ever disappear, and if crowds ever
go dumb, then better and best poetry itself will
be dead as King Pandion. No "Absent-Minded
Beggar," no "Recessional."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Whoever, then, will tell the truth about
poetry's part in the world of to-day and to-morrow must
not only know the course of all poetry through all
the yesterdays, but must keep all its present manifestations,
all its elements, sources, and allies at
his command. Not only the lords of verse are to
advise him; he shall take counsel with scullions
and potboys. It is that poet in every man, about
whom Sainte-Beuve discoursed, who can best tell
of the future of poetry. The enormous heed paid
to the great and solitary poets, as if there could
be a poet without audience or reader, has distorted
our vision until we think of poetry as a quite
solitary performance, a refuge from the world.
Is not poetry really a flight from self and solitude
to at least a conventional, imaginative society?
Poetry by its very form is a convention, an echo of
social consent; with its aid one may forget personal
debit and credit in the great account of humanity.
Now, as in the beginning, poetry is essentially
social; its future is largely a social problem.
How far, then, has man ceased to sing in crowds,
and taken to thinking by himself? What is the
shrinkage, quality as well as quantity, in the
proportion of verse to prose since the invention of
printing? Is the loss of so much communal song
in daily toil, in daily merriment, like the cutting
away of those forests which hold the rains and
supply the great rivers?</p>

<p class="indent">Waiting for complete and trustworthy
studies of humanity which shall answer some of those
queries, one may venture an opinion on the general
case. Just as one feels that forests may vanish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
and yet in some way the mighty watercourses
must be fed, so with poetry. Nothing has yet been
found to take the place of rhythm as sign of social
consent, the union of steps and voices in common
action; and whatever intellectual or spiritual
consolation may reach the lonely thinker, emotion
still drives him back upon the sympathy of man with man.</p>

<p class="indent">Human sympathy is thus at the heart of
every poetic utterance, whether humble or great;
rhythm is its outward and visible, once audible
sign; and poetry, from this point of view, would
therefore seem to be an enduring element in our life.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Iphigeneia, when she heard her doom</span>
<span class="i0">At Aulis, and when all beside the king</span>
<span class="i0">Had gone away, took his right hand, and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"O father! I am young and very happy.</span>
<span class="i0">I do not think the pious Calchas heard</span>
<span class="i0">Distinctly what the goddess spake; old age</span>
<span class="i0">Obscures the senses. If my nurse, who knew</span>
<span class="i0">My voice so well, sometimes misunderstood,</span>
<span class="i0">While I was resting on her knee both arms,</span>
<span class="i0">And hitting it to make her mind my words,</span>
<span class="i0">And looking in her face, and she in mine,</span>
<span class="i0">Might not he, also, hear one word amiss,</span>
<span class="i0">Spoken from so far off, even from Olympus?"</span>
<span class="i0">The father placed his cheek upon her head,</span>
<span class="i0">And tears dropt down it; but the king of men</span>
<span class="i0">Replied not. Then the maiden spake once more:</span>
<span class="i0">"O father! sayest thou nothing? Hearest thou not</span>
<span class="i0">Me, whom thou ever hast, until this hour,</span>
<span class="i0">Listened to fondly, and awakened me</span>
<span class="i0">To hear my voice amid the voice of birds,</span>
<span class="i0">When it was inarticulate as theirs,</span>
<span class="i0">And the down deadened it within the nest?"</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He moved her gently from him, silent still;</span>
<span class="i0">And this, and this alone, brought tears from her,</span>
<span class="i0">Although she saw fate nearer. Then with sighs:</span>
<span class="i0">"I thought to have laid down my hair before</span>
<span class="i0">Benignant Artemis, and not dimmed</span>
<span class="i0">Her polished altar with my virgin blood;</span>
<span class="i0">I thought to have selected the white flowers</span>
<span class="i0">To please the nymphs, and to have asked of each</span>
<span class="i0">By name, and with no sorrowful regret,</span>
<span class="i0">Whether, since both my parents willed the change,</span>
<span class="i0">I might at Hymen's feet bend my clipt brow;</span>
<span class="i0">And (after these who mind us girls the most)</span>
<span class="i0">Adore our own Athene, that she would</span>
<span class="i0">Regard me mildly with her azure eyes,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But, father, to see you no more, and see</span>
<span class="i0">Your love, O father! go ere I am gone!"</span>
<span class="i0">Gently he moved her off, and drew her back,</span>
<span class="i0">Bending his lofty head far over hers;</span>
<span class="i0">And the dark depths of nature heaved and burst.</span>
<span class="i0">He turned away,&mdash;not far, but silent still.</span>
<span class="i0">She now first shuddered; for in him, so nigh,</span>
<span class="i0">So long a silence seemed the approach of death,</span>
<span class="i0">And like it. Once again she raised her voice:</span>
<span class="i0">"O father! if the ships are now detained,</span>
<span class="i0">And all your vows move not the gods above,</span>
<span class="i0">When the knife strikes me there will be one prayer</span>
<span class="i0">The less to them; and purer can there be</span>
<span class="i0">Any, or more fervent, than the daughter's prayer</span>
<span class="i0">For her dear father's safety and success?"</span>
<span class="i0">A groan that shook him shook not his resolve.</span>
<span class="i0">An aged man now entered, and without</span>
<span class="i0">One word stepped slowly on, and took the wrist</span>
<span class="i0">Of the pale maiden. She looked up, and saw</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The fillet of the priest and calm, cold eyes.</span>
<span class="i0">Then turned she where her parent stood, and cried:</span>

<p class="blockquot">[It had been determined by the victorious Greeks to
sacrifice Polyxena, the daughter of Priam, King of Ilium,
and his wife Hecuba, on the tomb of the slain Achilleus.
Odysseus, sent by the Greeks to fetch the maiden, turned
a deaf ear to the entreaties of the mother, and Polyxena
herself addresses the Greek:]</p>

<span class="i8">A cowardly, life-loving, selfish soul!</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The whole vast concourse of the Achaian host</span>
<span class="i8">Stood round the tomb to see your daughter die.</span>
<span class="i8">Achilleus' son, taking her by the hand,</span>
<span class="i8">Placed her upon the mound, and I stayed near;</span>
<span class="i8">And youths, the flower of Greece, a chosen few,</span>
<span class="i8">With hands to check thy heifer, should she bound,</span>
<span class="i8">Attended. From a cup of carven gold,</span>
<span class="i8">Raised full of wine, Archilleus' son poured forth</span>
<span class="i8">Libation to his sire, and bade me sound</span>
<span class="i8">Silence throughout the whole Achaian host.</span>
<span class="i8">I, standing there, cried in the midst these words:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i8">'Silence, Achaians! let the host be still!</span>
<span class="i8">Hush, hold your voices!' Breathless stayed the crowd;</span>
<span class="i8">But he:&mdash;'O son of Peleus, father mine,</span>
<span class="i8">Take these libations pleasant to thy soul,</span>

<span class="i8">Sue thee: be kindly to us; loose our prows,</span>
<span class="i8">And let our barks go free; give safe return</span>
<span class="i8">Homeward from Troy to all, and happy voyage,'</span>
<span class="i8">Such words he spake, and the crowd prayed assent.</span>
<span class="i8">Then from the scabbard, by its golden hilt,</span>
<span class="i8">He drew the sword, and to the chosen youths</span>
<span class="i8">Signalled that they should bring the maid; but she,</span>
<span class="i8">Knowing her hour was come, spake thus, and said:</span>
<span class="i8">'O men of Argos, who have sacked my town,</span>
<span class="i8">Lo, of free will I die! Let no man touch</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i8">My body: boldly will I stretch my throat.</span>
<span class="i8">Nay, but I pray you set me free, then slay;</span>
<span class="i8">That free I thus may perish: 'mong the dead,</span>
<span class="i8">Being a queen, I blush to be called slave.'</span>
<span class="i8">The people shouted, and King Agamemnon</span>
<span class="i8">Bade the youths loose the maid, and set her free;</span>
<span class="i8">She, when she heard the order of the chiefs,</span>
<span class="i8">Seizing her mantle, from the shoulder down</span>
<span class="i8">To the soft centre of her snowy waist</span>
<span class="i8">Tore it, and showed her breasts and bosom fair</span>
<span class="i8">As in a statue. Bending then with knee</span>
<span class="i8">On earth, she spake a speech most piteous:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i8">'See you this breast, O youth? If breast you will,</span>
<span class="i8">Strike it; take heart: or if beneath my neck,</span>
<span class="i8">Lo! here my throat is ready for your sword!'</span>
<span class="i8">He, willing not, yet willing,&mdash;pity-stirred</span>
<span class="i8">In sorrow for the maiden,&mdash;with his blade</span>
<span class="i8">Severed the channels of her breath: blood flowed;</span>
<span class="i8">And she, though dying, still had thought to fall</span>
<span class="i8">In seemly wise, hiding what eyes should see not.</span>
<span class="i8">But when she breathed her life out from the blow,</span>
<span class="i8">Then was the Argive host in divers way</span>
<span class="i8">Of service parted; for some, bringing leaves,</span>
<span class="i8">Strewed them upon the corpse; some piled a pyre,</span>
<span class="i8">Dragging pine trunks and boughs; and he who bore none,</span>
<span class="i8">Heard from the bearers many a bitter word:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i8">'Standest thou, villain? hast thou then no robe,</span>
<span class="i8">No funeral honors for the maid to bring?</span>
<span class="i8">Wilt thou not go and get for her who died</span>
<span class="i8">Most nobly, bravest-souled, some gift?' Thus they</span>
<span class="i8">Spake of thy child in death:&mdash;O thou most blessed</span>
<span class="i8">Of women in thy daughter, most undone!"</span>

<span class="i0">And the last seller from the place had gone,</span>
<span class="i0">And not a sound was heard but of a dog</span>
<span class="i0">Crunching beneath the stall a refuse bone,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the dull echo from the pavement rung,</span>
<span class="i0">As the faint captive changed his weary feet.</span>
<span class="i0">He had stood there since morning, and had borne</span>
<span class="i0">From every eye in Athens the cold gaze</span>
<span class="i0">Of curious scorn. The Jew had taunted him</span>
<span class="i0">For an Olynthian slave. The buyer came</span>
<span class="i0">And roughly struck his palm upon his breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And touched his unhealed wounds, and with a sneer</span>
<span class="i0">Passed on; and when, with weariness o'erspent,</span>
<span class="i0">He bowed his head in a forgetful sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">The inhuman soldier smote him, and, with threats</span>
<span class="i0">Of torture to his children, summoned back</span>
<span class="i0">The ebbing blood into his pallid face.</span>

<span class="i0">When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept:</span>
<span class="i0">Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
<span class="i0">And Brutus is an honorable man.</span>
<span class="i0">You all did see that on the Lupercal</span>
<span class="i0">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</span>
<span class="i0">Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>

<span class="i0">I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</span>

<span class="i0">Drops like a plummet. Sohrab saw it come,</span>
<span class="i0">And sprang aside, quick as a flash. The spear</span>
<span class="i0">Hissed, and went quivering down into the sand,</span>
<span class="i0">Which it sent flying wide. Then Sohrab threw</span>
<span class="i0">In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield. Sharp rang</span>
<span class="i0">The iron plates, rang sharp, but turned the spear.</span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum seized his club, which none but he</span>
<span class="i0">Could wield&mdash;an unlapped trunk it was, and huge,</span>
<span class="i0">Still rough; like those which men, in treeless plains,</span>
<span class="i0">To build them boats, fish from the flooded rivers,</span>
<span class="i0">Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up</span>
<span class="i0">By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time</span>
<span class="i0">Has made in Himalayan forests wrack,</span>
<span class="i0">And strewn the channels with torn boughs&mdash;so huge</span>
<span class="i0">The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck</span>
<span class="i0">One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,</span>
<span class="i0">Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came</span>
<span class="i0">Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum followed his own blow, and fell</span>
<span class="i0">To his knees, and with his fingers clutched the sand.</span>
<span class="i0">And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,</span>
<span class="i0">And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay</span>
<span class="i0">Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;</span>
<span class="i0">But he looked on, and smiled, nor bared his sword;</span>
<span class="i0">But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">"Thou strik'st too hard; that club of thine will float</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the summer floods, and not my bones.</span>
<span class="i0">But rise, and be not wroth; not wroth am I.</span>
<span class="i0">No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou sayest thou art not Rustum; be it so.</span>
<span class="i0">Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?</span>
<span class="i0">Boy as I am, I have seen battles too;</span>
<span class="i0">Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard their hollow roar of dying men;</span>
<span class="i0">But never was my heart thus touched before.</span>
<span class="i0">Are they from heaven, these softenings of the heart?</span>
<span class="i0">O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!</span>
<span class="i0">Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,</span>
<span class="i0">And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,</span>
<span class="i0">And pledge each other in red wine, like friends;</span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.</span>
<span class="i0">There are enough foes in the Persian host</span>
<span class="i0">Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;</span>
<span class="i0">Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">May'st fight: fight them, when they confront thy spear.</span>
<span class="i0">But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"</span>
<span class="i2">He ceased. But while he spake Rustum had risen,</span>
<span class="i0">And stood erect, trembling with rage. His club</span>
<span class="i0">He left to lie, but had regained his spear,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose fiery point now in his mailed right hand</span>
<span class="i0">Blazed bright and baleful&mdash;like that autumn star,</span>
<span class="i0">The baleful sign of fevers. Dust had soiled</span>
<span class="i0">His stately crest, and dimmed his glittering arms.</span>
<span class="i0">His breast heaved; his lips foamed; and twice his voice</span>
<span class="i0">Was choked with rage. At last these words broke way:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!</span>
<span class="i0">Curled minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!</span>
<span class="i0">Fight! Let me hear thy hateful voice no more!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now</span>
<span class="i0">With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;</span>
<span class="i0">But on the Oxus sands, and in the dance</span>
<span class="i0">Of battle, and with me, who make no play</span>
<span class="i0">Of war. I fight it out, and hand to hand.</span>
<span class="i0">Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!</span>
<span class="i0">Remember all thy valor; try thy feints</span>
<span class="i0">And cunning; all the pity I had is gone;</span>
<span class="i0">Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts,</span>
<span class="i0">With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles."</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,</span>
<span class="i0">And he too drew his sword. At once they rushed</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Together; as two eagles on one prey</span>
<span class="i0">Come rushing down together from the clouds,</span>
<span class="i0">One from the east, one from the west. Their shields</span>
<span class="i0">Dashed with a clang together; and a din</span>
<span class="i0">Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters</span>
<span class="i0">Make often in the forest's heart at morn,</span>
<span class="i0">Of hewing axes, crashing trees; such blows</span>
<span class="i0">Rustum and Sohrab on each other hailed.</span>
<span class="i0">And you would say that sun and stars took part</span>
<span class="i0">In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud</span>
<span class="i0">Grew suddenly in heaven, and darkened the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose</span>
<span class="i0">Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,</span>
<span class="i0">And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair.</span>
<span class="i0">In gloom they twain were wrapped, and they alone;</span>
<span class="i0">For both the on-looking hosts on either hand</span>
<span class="i0">Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.</span>
<span class="i0">But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes</span>
<span class="i0">And laboring breath. First Rustum struck the shield</span>
<span class="i0">Which Sohrab held stiff out. The steel-spiked spear</span>
<span class="i0">Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin:</span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan.</span>
<span class="i0">Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm</span>
<span class="i0">Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest</span>
<span class="i0">He shore away; and that proud horse-hair plume,</span>
<span class="i0">Never till now defiled, sunk to the dust;</span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum bowed his head. But then the gloom</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Grew blacker; thunder rumbled in the air,</span>
<span class="i0">And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,</span>
<span class="i0">Who stood at hand, uttered a dreadful cry.</span>
<span class="i0">No horse's cry was that, most like the roar</span>
<span class="i0">Of some pained desert lion, who all day</span>
<span class="i0">Has trailed the hunter's javelin in his side,</span>
<span class="i0">And comes at night to die upon the sand.</span>
<span class="i0">The two hosts heard the cry, and quaked for fear;</span>
<span class="i0">And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream.</span>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab heard, and quailed not&mdash;but rushed on,</span>
<span class="i0">And struck again; and again Rustum bowed</span>
<span class="i0">His head. But this time all the blade, like glass,</span>
<span class="i0">Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his hand the hilt remained alone.</span>
<span class="i0">Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,</span>
<span class="i0">And shouted "Rustum!" Sohrab heard that shout,</span>
<span class="i0">And shrank amazed; back he recoiled one step,</span>
<span class="i0">And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form;</span>
<span class="i0">And then he stood bewildered; and he dropped</span>
<span class="i0">His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.</span>
<span class="i0">He reeled, and staggering back, sunk to the ground.</span>
<span class="i0">And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,</span>
<span class="i0">And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all</span>
<span class="i0">The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And Sohrab wounded, on the bloody sand.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Then with a bitter smile, Rustum began:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill</span>
<span class="i0">A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,</span>
<span class="i0">And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent;</span>
<span class="i0">Or else that the great Rustum would come down</span>
<span class="i0">Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move</span>
<span class="i0">His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.</span>
<span class="i0">And then all the Tartar host would praise</span>
<span class="i0">Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,</span>
<span class="i0">To glad thy father in his weak old age.</span>
<span class="i0">Fool! thou art slain, and by an unknown man!</span>
<span class="i0">Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be,</span>
<span class="i0">Than to thy friends, and to thy father old."</span>
<span class="i2">And with a fearless mien Sohrab replied:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!</span>
<span class="i0">No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.</span>
<span class="i0">For were I matched with ten such men as thou,</span>
<span class="i0">And I were he who till to-day I was,</span>
<span class="i0">They should be lying here, I standing there.</span>
<span class="i0">But that belovèd name unnerved my arm&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">That name, and something, I confess, in thee,</span>
<span class="i0">Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield</span>
<span class="i0">Fall; and thy spear transfixed an unarmed foe.</span>
<span class="i0">And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.</span>
<span class="i0">But hear thou this, fierce man&mdash;tremble to hear!</span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!</span>
<span class="i0">"My father, whom I seek through all the world,</span>
<span class="i0">He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"</span>
<span class="i7"><br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So Rustum knew not his own loss; but stood</span>
<span class="i0">Over his dying son, and knew him not.</span>
<span class="i2">But with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"What prate is this of fathers and revenge?</span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Rustum never had a son."</span>
<span class="i2">And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.</span>
<span class="i0">Surely the news will one day reach his ear&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,</span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;</span>
<span class="i0">And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap</span>
<span class="i0">To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Fierce man, bethink thee&mdash;for an only son!</span>
<span class="i0">What will that grief, what will that vengeance be!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, could I live till I that grief had seen!</span>
<span class="i0">Yet him I pity not so much, but her,</span>
<span class="i0">My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells</span>
<span class="i0">With that old king, her father, who grows gray</span>
<span class="i0">With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.</span>
<span class="i0">Her most I pity, who no more will see</span>
<span class="i0">Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,</span>
<span class="i0">With spoils and honor, when the war is done,</span>
<span class="i0">But a dark rumor will be bruited up,</span>
<span class="i0">From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;</span>
<span class="i0">And then will that defenceless woman learn</span>
<span class="i0">That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more;</span>
<span class="i0">But that in battle with a nameless foe,</span>
<span class="i0">By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain."</span>
<span class="i7"><br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son</span>
<span class="i0">Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!</span>
<span class="i0">Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men</span>
<span class="i0">Have told thee false&mdash;thou art not Rustum's son.</span>
<span class="i0">For Rustum had no son. One child he had&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But one&mdash;a girl; who with her mother now</span>
<span class="i0">Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us;</span>
<span class="i0">Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."</span>
<span class="i2">But Sohrab answered him in wrath; for now</span>
<span class="i0">The anguish of the deep-fixed spear grew fierce,</span>
<span class="i0">And he desired to draw forth the steel,</span>
<span class="i0">And let the blood flow free, and so to die.</span>
<span class="i0">But first he would convince his stubborn foe;</span>
<span class="i0">And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:</span>
<span class="i2">"Man, who art thou, who dost deny my words?</span>
<span class="i0">Truth sits upon the lips of dying men;</span>
<span class="i0">And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.</span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee, pricked upon this arm I bear</span>
<span class="i0">That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,</span>
<span class="i0">That she might prick it on the babe she bore."</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke: and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks;</span>
<span class="i0">And his knees tottered; and he smote his hand</span>
<span class="i0">Against his breast, his heavy mailèd hand,</span>
<span class="i0">That the hard iron corselet clanked aloud;</span>
<span class="i0">And to his heart he pressed the other hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie.</span>
<span class="i0">If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son."</span>
<span class="i2">Then, with weak, hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed</span>
<span class="i0">His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,</span>
<span class="i0">And showed a sign in faint vermilion points</span>
<span class="i0">Pricked. As a cunning workman, in Pekin,</span>
<span class="i0">Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,</span>
<span class="i0">An emperor's gift; at early morn he paints,</span>
<span class="i0">And all day long; and, when night comes, the lamp</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands:</span>
<span class="i0">So delicately pricked the sign appeared</span>
<span class="i0">On Sohrab's arm&mdash;the sign of Rustum's seal.</span>
<span class="i0">It was that griffin, which of old reared Zal,</span>
<span class="i0">Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,</span>
<span class="i0">A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks,</span>
<span class="i0">Him that kind creature found and reared and loved.</span>
<span class="i0">Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.</span>
<span class="i0">And Sohrab bared that figure on his arm,</span>
<span class="i0">And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And then he touched it with his hand and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"How sayest thou? Is that sign the proper sign</span>
<span class="i0">Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?"</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke: but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood</span>
<span class="i0">Speechless; and then he uttered one sharp cry&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"O, boy&mdash;thy father!"&mdash;and his voice choked there,</span>
<span class="i0">And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.</span>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab crawled to where he lay, and cast</span>
<span class="i0">His arms about his neck, and kissed his lips.</span>
<span class="i0">And with fond, faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,</span>
<span class="i0">Trying to call him back to life. And life</span>
<span class="i0">Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And they stood wide with horror; and he seized</span>
<span class="i0">In both his hands the dust which lay around,</span>
<span class="i0">And threw it on his head, and smirched his hair&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;</span>
<span class="i0">And strong, convulsive groanings shook his breast,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And his sobs choked him; and he clutched his sword</span>
<span class="i0">To draw it, and for ever let life out.</span>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands;</span>
<span class="i0">And with a soothing voice he spoke, and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day</span>
<span class="i0">The doom that at my birth was written down</span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, and thou art heaven's unconscious hand.</span>
<span class="i0">Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,</span>
<span class="i0">When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,</span>
<span class="i0">I know it. But fate trod those promptings down</span>
<span class="i0">Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged</span>
<span class="i0">The strife, and hurled me on my father's spear.</span>
<span class="i0">But let us speak no more of this&mdash;I find</span>
<span class="i0">My father; let me feel that I have found.</span>
<span class="i0">Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take</span>
<span class="i0">My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,</span>
<span class="i0">And wash them with thy tears, and say, 'My son!'</span>
<span class="i0">Quick! quick! for numbered are my sands of life,</span>
<span class="i0">And swift; for like the lightning to this field</span>
<span class="i0">I came, and like the wind I go away&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.</span>
<span class="i0">But it was writ in heaven that this should be."</span>
<span class="i2">So said he: and his voice released the heart</span>
<span class="i0">Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast</span>
<span class="i0">His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,</span>
<span class="i0">And kissed him. And awe fell on both the hosts</span>
<span class="i0">When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,</span>
<span class="i0">With his head bowing to the ground, and mane</span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe,</span>
<span class="i0">First to the one, then to the other moved</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His head, as if inquiring what their grief</span>
<span class="i0">Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">The big, warm tears rolled down, and caked the sand.</span>
<span class="i0">But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet</span>
<span class="i0">Should then have rotted on thy nimble joints,</span>
<span class="i0">When first they bore thy master to this field."</span>
<span class="i2">But Sohrab looked upon the horse, and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"Is this then Ruksh? How often, in past days,</span>
<span class="i0">My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">My terrible father's terrible horse! and said</span>
<span class="i0">That I should one day find thy lord and thee.</span>
<span class="i0">Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane.</span>
<span class="i0">O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;</span>
<span class="i0">For thou hast gone where I shall never go,</span>
<span class="i0">And snuffed the breezes of my father's home,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou hast trod the sands of Seïstan,</span>
<span class="i0">And seen the river of Helmund, and the lake</span>
<span class="i0">Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself</span>
<span class="i0">Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Corn in a golden platter soaked with wine&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And said&mdash;'O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!' But I</span>
<span class="i0">Have never known my grandsire's furrowed face,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor seen his lofty house in Seïstan,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;</span>
<span class="i0">But lodged among my father's foes, and seen</span>
<span class="i0">Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,</span>
<span class="i0">Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,</span>
<span class="i0">And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,</span>
<span class="i0">Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,</span>
<span class="i0">The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die."</span>
<span class="i2">And, with a heavy groan, Rustum replied:</span>
<span class="i0">"Oh that its waves were flowing over me!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh that I saw its grains of yellow silt</span>
<span class="i0">Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!"</span>
<span class="i2">And, with a grave, mild voice, Sohrab replied:</span>
<span class="i0">"Desire not that, my father! Thou must live;</span>
<span class="i0">For some are born to do great deeds, and live;</span>
<span class="i0">As some are born to be obscured, and die.</span>
<span class="i0">Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,</span>
<span class="i0">And reap a second glory in thine age;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.</span>
<span class="i0">But come! thou seest this great host of men</span>
<span class="i0">Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!</span>
<span class="i0">Let me entreat for them&mdash;what have they done?</span>
<span class="i0">They followed me, my hope, my fame, my star.</span>
<span class="i0">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.</span>
<span class="i0">But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,</span>
<span class="i0">But carry me with thee to Seïstan,</span>
<span class="i0">And place me on a bed, and mourn for me&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou, and the snow-haired Zal, and all thy friends.</span>
<span class="i0">And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And heap a stately mound above my bones,</span>
<span class="i0">And plant a far-seen pillar over all;</span>
<span class="i0">That so the passing horseman on the waste</span>
<span class="i0">May see my tomb a great way off, and say:</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whom his great father did in ignorance kill</i>&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And I be not forgotten in my grave."</span>

<span class="i2">And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:</span>
<span class="i2">"Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,</span>
<span class="i0">So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,</span>
<span class="i0">And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,</span>
<span class="i0">And carry thee away to Seïstan,</span>
<span class="i0">And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,</span>
<span class="i0">With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.</span>
<span class="i0">And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And heap a stately mound above thy bones,</span>
<span class="i0">And plant a far-seen pillar over all;</span>
<span class="i0">And men shall not forget thee in thy grave;</span>
<span class="i0">And I will spare thy host&mdash;yea, let them go&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.</span>
<span class="i0">What should I do with slaying any more?</span>
<span class="i0">For would that all whom I have ever slain</span>
<span class="i0">Might be once more alive&mdash;my bitterest foes,</span>
<span class="i0">And they who were called champions in their time,</span>
<span class="i0">And through whose death I won that fame I have&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And I were nothing but a common man,</span>
<span class="i0">A poor, mean soldier, and without renown;</span>
<span class="i0">So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!</span>
<span class="i0">Or rather, would that I, even I myself,</span>
<span class="i0">Might now be lying on this bloody sand,</span>
<span class="i0">Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine.</span>
<span class="i0">Not thou of mine; and I might die, not thou;</span>
<span class="i0">And I, not thou, be borne to Seïstan;</span>
<span class="i0">And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;</span>
<span class="i0">And say&mdash;<i>O son, I weep thee not too sore,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!</i>&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But now in blood and battles was my youth,</span>
<span class="i0">And full of blood and battles is my age;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall never end this life of blood."</span>
<span class="i2">Then at the point of death, Sohrab replied:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!</span>
<span class="i0">But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,</span>
<span class="i0">Not yet. But thou shalt have it on that day</span>
<span class="i0">When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou and the other peers of Kai-Khosroo,</span>
<span class="i0">Returning home over the salt, blue sea,</span>
<span class="i0">From laying thy dear master in his grave."</span>
<span class="i2">And Rustum gazed on Sohrab's face, and said:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!</span>
<span class="i0">Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke: and Sohrab smiled on him, and took</span>
<span class="i0">The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased</span>
<span class="i0">His wound's imperious anguish. But the blood</span>
<span class="i0">Came welling from the open gash, and life</span>
<span class="i0">Flowed with the stream; all down his cold white side</span>
<span class="i0">The crimson torrent ran, dim now, and soiled&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Like the soiled tissue of white violets</span>
<span class="i0">Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank</span>
<span class="i0">By romping children, whom their nurses call</span>
<span class="i0">From the hot fields at noon. His head drooped low;</span>
<span class="i0">His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,</span>
<span class="i0">Deep, heavy gasps, quivering through all his frame,</span>
<span class="i0">Convulsed him back to life, he opened them,</span>
<span class="i0">And fixed them feebly on his father's face.</span>
<span class="i0">Till now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unwillingly the spirit fled away,</span>
<span class="i0">Regretting the warm mansion which it left,</span>
<span class="i0">And youth and bloom, and this delightful world.</span>
<span class="i2">So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead.</span>
<span class="i0">And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak</span>
<span class="i0">Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.</span>
<span class="i0">As those black granite pillars, once high-reared</span>
<span class="i0">By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear</span>
<span class="i0">His house, now, mid their broken flights of steps,</span>
<span class="i0">Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain-side&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.</span>
<span class="i2">And night came down over the solemn waste,</span>
<span class="i0">And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,</span>
<span class="i0">And darkened all; and a cold fog, with night,</span>
<span class="i0">Crept from the Oxus.</span>

<span class="i0">"I' faith, 'tis an excellent bonfire!" quoth he;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So then to his palace returned he,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the morning, as he entered the hall,</span>

<span class="i0">As he looked, there came a man from his farm&mdash;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another came running presently,</span>

<span class="i0">He laid him down and closed his eyes,</span>

<span class="i0">For they have swum over the river so deep,</span>

<span class="i0">Down on his knees the bishop fell,</span>

<span class="i6"><b>COUNTESS LAURA.</b></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a dreary day in Padua.</span>
<span class="i0">The Countess Laura, for a single year</span>
<span class="i0">Fernando's wife, upon her bridal bed,</span>
<span class="i0">Like an uprooted lily on the snow,</span>
<span class="i0">The withered outcast of a festival,</span>
<span class="i0">Lay dead. She died of some uncertain ill,</span>
<span class="i0">That struck her almost on her wedding day,</span>
<span class="i0">And clung to her, and dragged her slowly down,</span>
<span class="i0">Thinning her cheeks and pinching her full lips,</span>
<span class="i0">Till in her chance, it seemed that with a year</span>
<span class="i0">Full half a century was overpast.</span>
<span class="i0">In vain had Paracelsus taxed his art,</span>
<span class="i0">And feigned a knowledge of her malady;</span>
<span class="i0">In vain had all the doctors, far and near,</span>
<span class="i0">Gathered around the mystery of her bed,</span>
<span class="i0">Draining her veins, her husband's treasury,</span>
<span class="i0">And physic's jargon, in a fruitless quest</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For causes equal to the dread result.</span>
<span class="i0">The Countess only smiled when they were gone,</span>
<span class="i0">Hugged her fair body with her little hands,</span>
<span class="i0">And turned upon her pillows wearily,</span>
<span class="i0">As though she fain would sleep no common sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">But the long, breathless slumber of the grave.</span>
<span class="i0">She hinted nothing. Feeble as she was,</span>
<span class="i0">The rack could not have wrung her secret out.</span>
<span class="i0">The Bishop, when he shrived her, coming forth,</span>
<span class="i0">Cried, in a voice of heavenly ecstasy,</span>
<span class="i0">"O blessed soul! with nothing to confess</span>
<span class="i0">Save virtues and good deeds, which she mistakes&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So humble is she&mdash;for our human sins!"</span>
<span class="i0">Praying for death, she tossed upon her bed</span>
<span class="i0">Day after day; as might a shipwrecked bark</span>
<span class="i0">That rocks upon one billow, and can make</span>
<span class="i0">No onward motion towards her port of hope.</span>
<span class="i0">At length, one morn, when those around her said,</span>
<span class="i0">"Surely the Countess mends, so fresh a light</span>
<span class="i0">Beams from her eyes and beautifies her face,"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">One morn in spring, when every flower of earth</span>
<span class="i0">Was opening to the sun, and breathing up</span>
<span class="i0">Its votive incense, her impatient soul</span>
<span class="i0">Opened itself, and so exhaled to heaven.</span>
<span class="i0">When the Count heard it, he reeled back a pace;</span>
<span class="i0">Then turned with anger on the messenger;</span>
<span class="i0">Then craved his pardon, and wept out his heart</span>
<span class="i0">Before the menial; tears, ah me! such tears</span>
<span class="i0">As love sheds only, and love only once.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he bethought him, "Shall this wonder die,</span>
<span class="i0">And leave behind no shadow? not a trace</span>
<span class="i0">Of all the glory that environed her,</span>
<span class="i0">That mellow nimbus circling round my star?"</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So, with his sorrow glooming in his face,</span>
<span class="i0">He paced along his gallery of art,</span>
<span class="i0">And strode among the painters, where they stood,</span>
<span class="i0">With Carlo, the Venetian, at their head,</span>
<span class="i0">Studying the Masters by the dawning light</span>
<span class="i0">Of his transcendent genius. Through the groups</span>
<span class="i0">Of gayly vestured artists moved the Count,</span>
<span class="i0">As some lone cloud of thick and leaden hue,</span>
<span class="i0">Packed with the secret of a coming storm,</span>
<span class="i0">Moves through the gold and crimson evening mists,</span>
<span class="i0">Deadening their splendor. In a moment still</span>
<span class="i0">Was Carlo's voice, and still the prattling crowd;</span>
<span class="i0">And a great shadow overwhelmed them all,</span>
<span class="i0">As their white faces and their anxious eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Pursued Fernando in his moody walk.</span>
<span class="i0">He paused, as one who balances a doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">Weighing two courses, then burst out with this:</span>
<span class="i0">"Ye all have seen the tidings in my face;</span>
<span class="i0">Or has the dial ceased to register</span>
<span class="i0">The workings of my heart? Then hear the bell,</span>
<span class="i0">That almost cracks its frame in utterance;</span>
<span class="i0">The Countess,&mdash;she is dead!" "Dead!" Carlo groaned.</span>
<span class="i0">And if a bolt from middle heaven had struck</span>
<span class="i0">His splendid features full upon the brow,</span>
<span class="i0">He could not have appeared more scathed and blanched.</span>
<span class="i0">"Dead!&mdash;dead!" He staggered to his easel-frame,</span>
<span class="i0">And clung around it, buffeting the air</span>
<span class="i0">With one wild arm, as though a drowning man</span>
<span class="i0">Hung to a spar and fought against the waves.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The Count resumed: "I came not here to grieve,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor see my sorrow in another's eyes.</span>
<span class="i0">Who'll paint the Countess, as she lies to-night</span>
<span class="i0">In state within the chapel? Shall it be</span>
<span class="i0">That earth must lose her wholly? that no hint</span>
<span class="i0">Of her gold tresses, beaming eyes, and lips</span>
<span class="i0">That talked in silence, and the eager soul</span>
<span class="i0">That ever seemed outbreaking through her clay,</span>
<span class="i0">And scattering glory round it,&mdash;shall all these</span>
<span class="i0">Be dull corruption's heritage, and we,</span>
<span class="i0">Poor beggars, have no legacy to show</span>
<span class="i0">That love she bore us? That were shame to love,</span>
<span class="i0">And shame to you, my masters." Carlo stalked</span>
<span class="i0">Forth from his easel stiffly as a thing</span>
<span class="i0">Moved by mechanic impulse. His thin lips,</span>
<span class="i0">And sharpened nostrils, and wan, sunken cheeks,</span>
<span class="i0">And the cold glimmer in his dusky eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Made him a ghastly sight. The throng drew back</span>
<span class="i0">As though they let a spectre through. Then he,</span>
<span class="i0">Fronting the Count, and speaking in a voice</span>
<span class="i0">Sounding remote and hollow, made reply:</span>
<span class="i0">"Count, I shall paint the Countess. 'T is my fate,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Not pleasure,&mdash;no, nor duty." But the Count,</span>
<span class="i0">Astray in woe, but understood assent,</span>
<span class="i0">Not the strange words that bore it; and he flung</span>
<span class="i0">His arm round Carlo, drew him to his breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And kissed his forehead. At which Carlo shrank;</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps 't was at the honor. Then the Count,</span>
<span class="i0">A little reddening at his public state,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Unseemly to his near and recent loss,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Withdrew in haste between the downcast eyes</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That did him reverence as he rustled by.</span>
<span class="i0">Night fell on Padua. In the chapel lay</span>
<span class="i0">The Countess Laura at the altar's foot.</span>
<span class="i0">Her coronet glittered on her pallid brows;</span>
<span class="i0">A crimson pall, weighed down with golden work,</span>
<span class="i0">Sown thick with pearls, and heaped with early flowers,</span>
<span class="i0">Draped her still body almost to the chin;</span>
<span class="i0">And over all a thousand candles flamed</span>
<span class="i0">Against the winking jewels, or streamed down</span>
<span class="i0">The marble aisle, and flashed along the guard</span>
<span class="i0">Of men-at-arms that slowly wove their turns,</span>
<span class="i0">Backward and forward, through the distant gloom.</span>
<span class="i0">When Carlo entered, his unsteady feet</span>
<span class="i0">Scarce bore him to the altar, and his head</span>
<span class="i0">Drooped down so low that all his shining curls</span>
<span class="i0">Poured on his breast, and veiled his countenance.</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his easel a half-finished work,</span>
<span class="i0">The secret labor of his studio,</span>
<span class="i0">Said from the canvas, so that none might err,</span>
<span class="i0">"I am the Countess Laura." Carlo kneeled,</span>
<span class="i0">And gazed upon the picture; as if thus,</span>
<span class="i0">Through those clear eyes, he saw the way to heaven.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he arose; and as a swimmer comes</span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the waves, he shook his locks aside,</span>
<span class="i0">Emerging from his dream, and standing firm</span>
<span class="i0">Upon a purpose with his sovereign will.</span>
<span class="i0">He took his palette, murmuring, "Not yet!"</span>
<span class="i0">Confidingly and softly to the corpse,</span>
<span class="i0">And as the veriest drudge, who plies his art</span>
<span class="i0">Against his fancy, he addressed himself</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With stolid resolution to his task,</span>
<span class="i0">Turning his vision on his memory,</span>
<span class="i0">And shutting out the present, till the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">The gilded pall, the lights, the pacing guard,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the meaning of that solemn scene</span>
<span class="i0">Became as nothing, and creative Art</span>
<span class="i0">Resolved the whole to chaos, and reformed</span>
<span class="i0">The elements according to her law:</span>
<span class="i0">So Carlo wrought, as though his eye and hand</span>
<span class="i0">Were Heaven's unconscious instruments, and worked</span>
<span class="i0">The settled purpose of Omnipotence.</span>
<span class="i0">And it was wondrous how the red, the white,</span>
<span class="i0">The ochre, and the umber, and the blue,</span>
<span class="i0">From mottled blotches, hazy and opaque,</span>
<span class="i0">Grew into rounded forms and sensuous lines;</span>
<span class="i0">How just beneath the lucid skin the blood</span>
<span class="i0">Glimmered with warmth; the scarlet lips apart</span>
<span class="i0">Bloomed with the moisture of the dews of life;</span>
<span class="i0">How the light glittered through and underneath</span>
<span class="i0">The golden tresses, and the deep, soft eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Became intelligent with conscious thought,</span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat troubled underneath the arch</span>
<span class="i0">Of eyebrows but a little too intense</span>
<span class="i0">For perfect beauty; how the pose and poise</span>
<span class="i0">Of the lithe figure on its tiny foot</span>
<span class="i0">Suggested life just ceased from motion; so</span>
<span class="i0">That any one might cry, in marvelling joy,</span>
<span class="i0">"That creature lives,&mdash;has senses, mind, a soul</span>
<span class="i0">To win God's love or dare hell's subtleties!"</span>
<span class="i0">The artist paused. The ratifying "Good!"</span>
<span class="i0">Trembled upon his lips. He saw no touch</span>
<span class="i0">To give or soften. "It is done," he cried,&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"My task, my duty! Nothing now on earth</span>
<span class="i0">Can taunt me with a work left unfulfilled!"</span>
<span class="i0">The lofty flame, which bore him up so long,</span>
<span class="i0">Died in the ashes of humanity;</span>
<span class="i0">And the mere man rocked to and fro again</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the centre of his wavering heart.</span>
<span class="i0">He put aside his palette, as if thus</span>
<span class="i0">He stepped from sacred vestments, and assumed</span>
<span class="i0">A mortal function in the common world.</span>
<span class="i0">"Now for my rights!" he muttered, and approached</span>
<span class="i0">The noble body. "O lily of the world!</span>
<span class="i0">So withered, yet so lovely! what wast thou</span>
<span class="i0">To those who came thus near thee&mdash;for I stood</span>
<span class="i0">Without the pale of thy half-royal rank&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When thou wast budding, and the streams of life</span>
<span class="i0">Made eager struggles to maintain thy bloom,</span>
<span class="i0">And gladdened heaven dropped down in gracious dews</span>
<span class="i0">On its transplanted darling? Hear me now!</span>
<span class="i0">I say this but in justice, not in pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Not to insult thy high nobility,</span>
<span class="i0">But that the poise of things in God's own sight</span>
<span class="i0">May be adjusted; and hereafter I</span>
<span class="i0">May urge a claim that all the powers of heaven</span>
<span class="i0">Shall sanction, and with clarions blow abroad.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Laura you loved me! Look not so severe,</span>
<span class="i0">With your cold brows, and deadly, close-drawn lips!</span>
<span class="i0">You proved it, Countess, when you died for it,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Let it consume you in the wearing strife</span>
<span class="i0">It fought with duty in your ravaged heart.</span>
<span class="i0">I knew it ever since that summer day</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I painted Lilla, the pale beggar's child,</span>
<span class="i0">At rest beside the fountain; when I felt&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">O Heaven!&mdash;the warmth and moisture of your breath</span>
<span class="i0">Blow through my hair, as with your eager soul&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting soul and body go as one&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">You leaned across my easel till our cheeks&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! 't was not your purpose&mdash;touched, and clung!</span>
<span class="i0">Well, grant 't was genius; and is genius naught?</span>
<span class="i0">I ween it wears as proud a diadem&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, in this very world&mdash;as that you wear.</span>
<span class="i0">A king has held my palette, a grand-duke</span>
<span class="i0">Has picked my brush up, and a pope has begged</span>
<span class="i0">The favor of my presence in his Rome.</span>
<span class="i0">I did not go; I put my fortune by.</span>
<span class="i0">I need not ask you why: you knew too well.</span>
<span class="i0">It was but natural, it was no way strange,</span>
<span class="i0">That I should love you. Everything that saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Or had its other senses, loved you, sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">And I among them. Martyr, holy saint,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I see the halo curving round your head,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I loved you once; but now I worship you,</span>
<span class="i0">For the great deed that held my love aloof,</span>
<span class="i0">And killed you in the action! I absolve</span>
<span class="i0">Your soul from any taint. For from the day</span>
<span class="i0">Of that encounter by the fountain-side</span>
<span class="i0">Until this moment, never turned on me</span>
<span class="i0">Those tender eyes, unless they did a wrong</span>
<span class="i0">To nature by the cold, defiant glare</span>
<span class="i0">With which they chilled me. Never heard I word</span>
<span class="i0">Of softness spoken by those gentle lips;</span>
<span class="i0">Never received a bounty from that hand</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which gave to all the world. I know the cause.</span>
<span class="i0">You did your duty,&mdash;not for honor's sake,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to save sin, or suffering, or remorse,</span>
<span class="i0">Or all the ghosts that haunt a woman's shame,</span>
<span class="i0">But for the sake of that pure, loyal love</span>
<span class="i0">Your husband bore you. Queen, by grace of God,</span>
<span class="i0">I bow before the lustre of your throne!</span>
<span class="i0">I kiss the edges of your garment-hem,</span>
<span class="i0">And hold myself ennobled! Answer me,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">If I had wronged you, you would answer me</span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dusty porches of the tomb:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Is this a dream, a falsehood? or have I</span>
<span class="i0">Spoken the very truth?" "The very truth!"</span>
<span class="i0">A voice replied; and at his side he saw</span>
<span class="i0">A form, half shadow and half substance, stand,</span>
<span class="i0">Or, rather, rest; for on the solid earth</span>
<span class="i0">It had no footing, more than some dense mist</span>
<span class="i0">That waves o'er the surface of the ground</span>
<span class="i0">It scarcely touches. With a reverent look</span>
<span class="i0">The shadow's waste and wretched face was bent</span>
<span class="i0">Above the picture; as though greater awe</span>
<span class="i0">Subdued its awful being, and appalled,</span>
<span class="i0">With memories of terrible delight</span>
<span class="i0">And fearful wonder, its devouring gaze.</span>
<span class="i0">"You make what God makes,&mdash;beauty," said the shape.</span>
<span class="i0">"And might not this, this second Eve, console</span>
<span class="i0">The emptiest heart? Will not this thing outlast</span>
<span class="i0">The fairest creature fashioned in the flesh?</span>
<span class="i0">Before that figure, Time, and Death himself,</span>
<span class="i0">Stand baffled and disarmed. What would you ask</span>
<span class="i0">More than God's power, from nothing to create?"</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The artist gazed upon the boding form,</span>
<span class="i0">And answered: "Goblin, if you had a heart,</span>
<span class="i0">That were an idle question. What to me</span>
<span class="i0">Is my creative power, bereft of love?</span>
<span class="i0">Or what to God would be that self-same power,</span>
<span class="i0">If so bereaved?" "And yet the love, thus mourned,</span>
<span class="i0">You calmly forfeited. For had you said</span>
<span class="i0">To living Laura&mdash;in her burning ears&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">One half that you professed to Laura dead,</span>
<span class="i0">She would have been your own. These contraries</span>
<span class="i0">Sort not with my intelligence. But speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Were Laura living, would the same stale play</span>
<span class="i0">Of raging passion tearing out its heart</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the rock of duty be performed?"</span>
<span class="i0">"The same, O phantom, while the heart I bear</span>
<span class="i0">Trembled, but turned not its magnetic faith</span>
<span class="i0">From God's fixed centre." "If I wake for you</span>
<span class="i0">This Laura,&mdash;give her all the bloom and glow</span>
<span class="i0">Of that midsummer day you hold so dear,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The smile, the motion, the impulsive soul,</span>
<span class="i0">The love of genius,&mdash;yea, the very love,</span>
<span class="i0">The mortal, hungry, passionate, hot love,</span>
<span class="i0">She bore you, flesh to flesh,&mdash;would you receive</span>
<span class="i0">That gift, in all its glory, at my hands?"</span>
<span class="i0">A smile of malice curled the tempter's lips,</span>
<span class="i0">And glittered in the caverns of his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Mocking the answer. Carlo paled and shook;</span>
<span class="i0">A woful spasm went shuddering through his frame,</span>
<span class="i0">Curdling his blood, and twisting his fair face</span>
<span class="i0">With nameless torture. But he cried aloud,</span>

<span class="i2">Its sleepless summer of long light,</span>

<span class="i2"><b>THE SACK OF BALTIMORE.</b></span>
</div></div>

<p class="blockquot">[Baltimore is a small seaport in the barony of Carbery,
in South Munster. It grew up around a castle of O'Driscoll's,
and was, after his ruin, colonized by the English.
On the 20th of June, 1631, the crews of two Algerine
galleys landed in the dead of the night, sacked the town,
and bore off into slavery all who were not too old, or too
young, or too fierce, for their purpose. The pirates were
steered up the intricate channel by one Hackett, a Dungarvan
fisherman, whom they had taken at sea for the
purpose. Two years later, he was convicted of the crime
and executed. Baltimore never recovered from this.]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The summer sun is falling soft on Carbery's hundred isles,</span>
<span class="i0">The summer sun is gleaming still through Gabriel's rough defiles,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Old Inisherkin's crumbled fane looks like a moulting bird;</span>
<span class="i0">And in a calm and sleepy swell the ocean tide is heard:</span>
<span class="i0">The hookers lie upon the beach; the children cease their play;</span>
<span class="i0">The gossips leave the little inn; the households kneel to pray;</span>
<span class="i0">And full of love and peace and rest,&mdash;its daily labor o'er,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Upon that cosy creek there lay the town of Baltimore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A deeper rest, a starry trance, has come with midnight there;</span>
<span class="i0">No sound, except that throbbing wave, in earth or sea or air.</span>
<span class="i0">The massive capes and ruined towers seem conscious of the calm;</span>
<span class="i0">The fibrous sod and stunted trees are breathing heavy balm.</span>
<span class="i0">So still the night, these two long barks round Dunashad that glide</span>
<span class="i0">Must trust their oars&mdash;methinks not few&mdash;against the ebbing tide.</span>
<span class="i0">O, some sweet mission of true love must urge them to the shore,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">They bring some lover to his bride, who sighs in Baltimore!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All, all asleep within each roof along that rocky street,</span>
<span class="i0">And these must be the lover's friends, with gently gliding feet.</span>
<span class="i0">A stifled gasp! a dreamy noise! The roof is in a flame!</span>
<span class="i0">From out their beds, and to their doors, rush maid and sire and dame,</span>
<span class="i0">And meet upon the threshold stone, the gleaming sabre's fall,</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er each black and bearded face the white or crimson shawl.</span>
<span class="i0">The yell of "Allah!" breaks above the prayer and shriek and roar&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">O blessèd God! the Algerine is lord of Baltimore!</span>
<span class="i0">Then flung the youth his naked hand against the shearing sword;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then sprung the mother on the brand with which her son was gored;</span>
<span class="i0">Then sunk the grandsire on the floor, his grand-babes clutching wild;</span>
<span class="i0">Then fled the maiden moaning faint, and nestled with the child.</span>
<span class="i0">But see, yon pirate strangling lies, and crushed with splashing heel,</span>
<span class="i0">While o'er him in an Irish hand there sweeps his Syrian steel;</span>
<span class="i0">Though virtue sink, and courage fail, and misers yield their store,</span>
<span class="i0">There 's one hearth well avenged in the sack of Baltimore!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Midsummer morn, in woodland nigh, the birds begin to sing;</span>
<span class="i0">They see not now the milking-maids, deserted is the spring!</span>
<span class="i0">Midsummer day, this gallant rides from the distant Bandon's town,</span>
<span class="i0">These hookers crossed from stormy Skull, that skiff from Affadown.</span>
<span class="i0">They only found the smoking walls with neighbors' blood besprent,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the strewed and trampled beach awhile they wildly went,</span>
<span class="i0">Then dashed to sea, and passed Cape Clear, and saw, five leagues before,</span>
<span class="i0">The pirate-galleys vanishing that ravaged Baltimore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O, some must tug the galley's oar, and some must tend the steed,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This boy will bear a Scheik's chibouk, and that a Bey's jerreed.</span>
<span class="i0">O, some are for the arsenals by beauteous Dardanelles,</span>
<span class="i0">And some are in the caravan to Mecca's sandy dells.</span>
<span class="i0">The maid that Bandon gallant sought is chosen for the Dey,</span>
<span class="i0">She 's safe,&mdash;she 's dead,&mdash;she stabbed him in the midst of his Serai;</span>
<span class="i0">And when to die a death of fire that noble maid they bore,</span>
<span class="i0">She only smiled,&mdash;O'Driscoll's child,&mdash;she thought of Baltimore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'T is two long years since sunk the town beneath that bloody band,</span>
<span class="i0">And all around its trampled hearth a larger concourse stand,</span>
<span class="i0">Where high upon a gallows-tree a yelling wretch is seen,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">'T is Hackett of Dungarvan,&mdash;he who steered the Algerine!</span>
<span class="i0">He fell amid a sullen shout, with scarce a passing prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">For he had slain the kith and kin of many a hundred there:</span>
<span class="i0">Some muttered of MacMorrogh, who had brought the Norman o'er,</span>
<span class="i0">Some cursed him with Iscariot, that day in Baltimore.</span>

<span class="i0">Was but a moment's act, and he was gone</span>

<span class="i0">Passing a neighbor's cottage in his way,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Mark Fenton's,&mdash;him he took with short delay</span>

<span class="i0">What need might be? They struck into the track</span>

<span class="i0">In every roadside thicket, hole, nook,</span>

<span class="i0">Something brushed past them. That was Tinker's bark,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Unheeded, he had followed in the dark,</span>
<span class="i0">Close at his master's heels; but, swift as light,</span>
<span class="i0">Darted before them now. "Be sure he 's right,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He 's on the track," cried Ambrose. "Hold the light</span>
<span class="i0">Low down,&mdash;he 's making for the water. Hark!</span>
<span class="i0">I know that whine,&mdash;the old dog 's found them, Mark."</span>
<span class="i0">So speaking, breathlessly he hurried on</span>
<span class="i0">Toward the old crazy foot-bridge. It was gone!</span>
<span class="i0">And all his dull contracted light could show</span>
<span class="i0">Was the black void and dark swollen stream below.</span>
<span class="i0">"Yet there 's life somewhere,&mdash;more than Tinker's whine,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">That 's sure," said Mark. "So, let the lantern shine</span>

<span class="i0">And a low sob came faintly on the ear,</span>
<span class="i0">Mocked by the sobbing gust. Down, quick as thought,</span>
<span class="i0">Into the stream leapt Ambrose, where he caught</span>
<span class="i0">Fast hold of something,&mdash;a dark huddled heap,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Half in the water, where 't was scarce knee-deep</span>
<span class="i0">For a tall man, and half above it, propped</span>

<span class="i0">Endways the broken plank, when it gave way</span>
<span class="i0">With the two little ones that luckless day!</span>
<span class="i0">"My babes!&mdash;my lambkins!" was the father's cry.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>One little voice</i> made answer, "Here am I!"</span>
<span class="i0">'T was Lizzy's. There she crouched with face as white,</span>

<span class="i0">Wide parted, showing all the pearly teeth,</span>
<span class="i0">And eyes on some dark object underneath,</span>
<span class="i0">Washed by the turbid water, fixed as stone,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">One arm and hand stretched out, and rigid grown,</span>
<span class="i0">Grasping, as in the death-gripe, Jenny's frock.</span>
<span class="i0">There she lay drowned. Could he sustain that shock,</span>
<span class="i0">The doting father? Where 's the unriven rock</span>

<span class="i0">Its covering gone, the lovely little head</span>
<span class="i0">Hung like a broken snowdrop all aside;</span>
<span class="i0">And one small hand,&mdash;the mother's shawl was tied,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaving <i>that</i> free, about the child's small form,</span>
<span class="i0">As was her last injunction&mdash;"<i>fast</i> and warm"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Too well obeyed,&mdash;too fast! A fatal hold</span>
<span class="i0">Affording to the scrag by a thick fold</span>
<span class="i0">That caught and pinned her in the river's bed,</span>
<span class="i0">While through the reckless water overhead</span>
<span class="i0">Her life-breath bubbled up.</span>
<span class="i24">"She might have lived,</span>
<span class="i0">Struggling like Lizzy," was the thought that rived</span>
<span class="i0">The wretched mother's heart, when she knew all,</span>
<span class="i0">"But for my foolishness about that shawl!</span>
<span class="i0">And Master would have kept them back the day;</span>

<span class="i0">In such wild weather!"</span>

<span class="i0">The father glued his warm ones, ere they rolled</span>
<span class="i0">Once more the fatal shawl&mdash;her winding-sheet&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">About the precious clay. One heart still beat,</span>
<span class="i0">Warmed by his heart's blood. To his only child</span>
<span class="i0">He turned him, but her piteous moaning mild</span>
<span class="i0">Pierced him afresh,&mdash;and now she knew him not.</span>
<span class="i0">"Mother!" she murmured, "who says I forgot?</span>
<span class="i0">Mother! indeed, indeed, I kept fast hold,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through air made heavy with vapors murk,</span>
<span class="i2">O'er slack and cinders in heaps and holes,</span>
<span class="i0">The engine-driver came to his work,</span>
<span class="i2">Burly and bluff as a bag of coals;</span>
<span class="i0">With a thick gold chain where he bulged the most,</span>
<span class="i0">And a beard like a brush, and a face like a toast,</span>
<span class="i0">And a hat half-eaten by fire and frost;</span>
<span class="i0">And a diamond pin in the folded dirt</span>
<span class="i0">Of the shawl that served him for collar and shirt.</span>
<span class="i2">Whenever he harnessed his steed of mettle:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The shovel-fed monster that could not tire,</span>
<span class="i0">With limbs of steel and entrails of fire;</span>
<span class="i2">Above us it sang like a tea-time kettle.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He came to his salamander toils</span>
<span class="i2">In what seemed a devil's cast-off suit,</span>
<span class="i0">All charred, and discolored with rain and oils,</span>
<span class="i2">And smeared and sooted from muffler to boot.</span>
<span class="i0">Some wiping&mdash;it struck him&mdash;his paws might suffer</span>
<span class="i0">With a wisp of thread he found on the buffer</span>
<span class="i0">(The improvement effected was not very great);</span>
<span class="i0">Then he spat, and passed his pipe to his mate.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his whole face laughed with an honest mirth,</span>
<span class="i0">As any extant on this grimy earth,</span>
<span class="i2">Welcoming me to his murky region;</span>
<span class="i0">And had you known him, I tell you this&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Though your bright hair shiver and sink at its roots,</span>
<span class="i2">O piano-fingering fellow-collegian&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">You would have returned no cold salutes</span>
<span class="i2">To the cheery greeting of old Chris,</span>
<span class="i2">But locked your hand in the vise of his.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For at night when the sleet-storm shatters and scatters,</span>
<span class="i0">And clangs on the pane like a pile of fetters,</span>
<span class="i0">He flies through it all with the world's love-letters:</span>
<span class="i0">The master of mighty leviathan motions,</span>
<span class="i2">That make for him storm when the nights are fair,</span>
<span class="i2">And cook him with fire and carve him with air,</span>
<span class="i0">While we sleep soft on the carriage cushions,</span>
<span class="i0">And he looks sharp for the signals, blear-eyed.</span>
<span class="i2">Often had Chris over England rolled me;</span>
<span class="i2">You shall hear a story he told me&mdash;</span>

<span class="i0">We were driving the down express;</span>

<span class="i0">Over the valleys and villages,</span>
<span class="i2">Over the marshes and coppices,</span>
<span class="i0">Over the river, deep and broad;</span>
<span class="i0">Through the mountain, under the road,</span>
<span class="i12">Flying along,</span>
<span class="i12">Tearing along.</span>
<span class="i0">Thunderbolt engine, swift and strong,</span>
<span class="i2">Fifty tons she was, whole and sole!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i2">I had been promoted to the express:</span>
<span class="i0">I warrant I was proud and gay.</span>
<span class="i0">It was the evening that ended May,</span>
<span class="i2">And the sky was a glory of tenderness.</span>
<span class="i0">We were thundering down to a midland town,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">It doesn't matter about the name,</span>
<span class="i0">For we didn't stop there, or anywhere</span>
<span class="i2">For a dozen miles on either side.</span>
<span class="i2">Well, as I say, just there you slide,</span>
<span class="i0">With your steam shut off and your brakes in hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Down the steepest and longest grade in the land,</span>
<span class="i0">At a pace that, I promise you, is grand.</span>
<span class="i2">We were just there with the express,</span>
<span class="i2">When I caught sight of a girl's white dress</span>
<span class="i0">On the bank ahead; and as we passed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">You have no notion how fast&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She sank back scared from our baleful blast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We were going&mdash;a mile and a quarter a minute&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">With vans and carriages&mdash;down the incline!</span>
<span class="i0">But I saw her face, and the sunshine in it;</span>
<span class="i2">I looked in her eyes, and she looked in mine</span>
<span class="i0">As the train went by, like a shot from a mortar:</span>
<span class="i2">A roaring hell-breath of dust and smoke.</span>
<span class="i2">And it was a minute before I woke,</span>
<span class="i0">When she lay behind us&mdash;a mile and a quarter.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the years went on, and the express</span>
<span class="i0">Leaped in her black resistlessness,</span>
<span class="i2">Evening by evening, England through.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">Will&mdash;God rest him!&mdash;was found&mdash;a mash</span>
<span class="i4">Of bleeding rags, in a fearful smash</span>
<span class="i2">He made of Christmas train at Crewe.</span>
<span class="i0">It chanced I was ill the night of the mess,</span>
<span class="i2">Or I shouldn't now be here alive;</span>
<span class="i0">But thereafter, the five o'clock out express,</span>
<span class="i2">Evening by evening, I used to drive.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And often I saw her: that lady, I mean,</span>
<span class="i2">That I spoke of before. She often stood</span>
<span class="i0">Atop of the bank;&mdash;it was pretty high,</span>
<span class="i2">Say, twenty feet, and backed by a wood.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She would pick daisies out of the green</span>
<span class="i2">To fling down at us as we went by.</span>
<span class="i0">We had grown to be friends, too, she and I.</span>
<span class="i0">Though I was a stalwart, grimy chap,</span>
<span class="i0">And she a lady! I'd wave my cap</span>
<span class="i2">Evening by evening, when I'd spy</span>
<span class="i0">That she was there, in the summer air,</span>
<span class="i2">Watching the sun sink out of the sky.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, I didn't see her every night:</span>
<span class="i2">Bless you! no; just now and then,</span>
<span class="i0">And not at all for a twelvemonth quite.</span>
<span class="i2">Then, one evening, I saw her again,</span>
<span class="i0">Alone, as ever&mdash;but wild and pale&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Climbing down on the line, on the very rail,</span>
<span class="i0">While a light as of hell from our wild wheels broke,</span>
<span class="i2">Tearing down the slope with their devilish clamors</span>
<span class="i2">And deafening din, as of giant hammers</span>
<span class="i0">That smote in a whirlwind of dust and smoke</span>
<span class="i2">All the instant or so that we sped to meet her.</span>
<span class="i2">Never, O never, had she seemed sweeter!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I let yell the whistle, reversing the stroke,</span>
<span class="i0">Down that awful incline; and signalled the guard</span>
<span class="i0">To put on his brakes at once, and <span class="smcap">HARD</span>!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Though we couldn't have stopped. We tattered the rail</span>
<span class="i0">Into splinters and sparks, but without avail.</span>
<span class="i0">We couldn't stop; and she wouldn't stir,</span>
<span class="i2">Saving to turn us her eyes, and stretch</span>
<span class="i2">Her arms to us:&mdash;and the desperate wretch</span>
<span class="i0">I pitied, comprehending her.</span>
<span class="i0">So the brakes let off, and the steam full again,</span>
<span class="i0">Sprang down on the lady the terrible train.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She never flinched. We beat her down,</span>
<span class="i0">And ran on through the lighted length of the town</span>
<span class="i2">Before we could stop to see what was done.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yes, I've run over more than one!</span>
<span class="i0">Full a dozen, I should say; but none</span>
<span class="i0">That I pitied as I pitied her.</span>
<span class="i0">If I could have stopped&mdash;with all the spur</span>
<span class="i0">Of the train's weight on, and cannily&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But it never would do with a lad like me</span>
<span class="i0">And she a lady,&mdash;or had been.&mdash;Sir?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">We won't say any more of her;</span>
<span class="i0">The world is hard. But I'm her friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Right through&mdash;down to the world's end.</span>
<span class="i0">It is a curl of her sunny hair</span>
<span class="i0">Set in this locket that I wear;</span>
<span class="i0">I picked it off the big wheel there.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Time's up, Jack&mdash;Stand clear, sir. Yes,</span>
<span class="i0">We're going out with the express.</span>

<span class="i0">All the while holding upon his breast</span>
<span class="i2">A little pet parrot whose wings were clipped.</span>
<span class="i0">And, as the boy and the bird went by,</span>
<span class="i2">Swinging away on a tall wave's crest,</span>

<span class="i0">Cold and hardship such work had done</span>
<span class="i2">That few seemed frightened when death was near.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus every soul on board went down,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Sailor and passenger, little and great;</span>

<span class="i0">Where were you in that hour of death?</span>

<span class="i0">Hers was the subtlest spell by far</span>
<span class="i2">Of all that sets young hearts romancing:</span>

<span class="i0">Her every look, her every smile,</span>

<span class="i0">The last trip, their goods shipped by the steamer Arago,</span>

<span class="i0">Sufficient to fill the largest-sized chest,</span>
<span class="i0">Which did not appear on the ship's manifest,</span>

<span class="i0">Such particular interest, that they invested</span>

<span class="i0">Of muslins, embroideries, worked under-clothes,</span>
<span class="i0">Gloves, handkerchiefs, scarfs, and such trifles as those;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, wrapped in great shawls, like Circassian beauties,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave <i>good-bye</i> to the ship, and <i>go-by</i> to the duties.</span>

<span class="i2">For an actual belle and a possible bride;</span>

<span class="i0">This same Miss McFlimsey, of Madison Square,</span>

<span class="i2">Like Powers' Greek Slave, or the Medici Venus;</span>
<span class="i0">But I do mean to say, I have heard her declare,</span>
<span class="i2">When, at the same moment, she had on a dress</span>
<span class="i2">Which cost five hundred dollars, and not a cent less,</span>
<span class="i2">And jewelry worth ten times more, I should guess,</span>

<span class="i0">I should mention just here, that out of Miss Flora's</span>
<span class="i0">Two hundred and fifty or sixty adorers,</span>
<span class="i0">I had just been selected as he who should throw all</span>
<span class="i0">The rest in the shade, by the gracious bestowal</span>
<span class="i0">On myself after twenty or thirty rejections,</span>
<span class="i0">Of those fossil remains which she called her "affections,"</span>
<span class="i0">And that rather decayed, but well-known work of art,</span>
<span class="i0">Which Miss Flora persisted in styling her "heart."</span>
<span class="i0">So we were engaged. Our troth had been plighted,</span>
<span class="i0">Not by moonbeam or starbeam, by fountain or grove,</span>
<span class="i0">But in a front parlor, most brilliantly lighted,</span>
<span class="i2">Beneath the gas-fixtures we whispered our love,</span>
<span class="i0">Without any romance or raptures or sighs,</span>
<span class="i0">Without any tears in Miss Flora's blue eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Or blushes, or transports, or such silly actions,</span>
<span class="i0">It was one of the quietest business transactions,</span>
<span class="i0">With a very small sprinkling of sentiment, if any,</span>
<span class="i0">And a very large diamond imported by Tiffany.</span>
<span class="i0">On her virginal lips while I printed a kiss,</span>
<span class="i0">She exclaimed, as a sort of parenthesis,</span>
<span class="i0">And by way of putting me quite at my ease,</span>
<span class="i0">"You know, I'm to polka as much as I please,</span>
<span class="i0">And flirt when I like,&mdash;now, stop, don't you speak,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And you must not come here more than twice in the week,</span>
<span class="i0">Or talk to me either at party or ball,</span>
<span class="i0">But always be ready to come when I call;</span>
<span class="i0">So don't prose to me about duty and stuff,</span>
<span class="i0">If we don't break this off, there will be time enough</span>
<span class="i0">For that sort of thing; but the bargain must be</span>
<span class="i0">That, as long as I choose, I am perfectly free,</span>
<span class="i0">For this is a kind of engagement, you see,</span>
<span class="i0">Which is binding on you but not binding on me."</span>

<span class="i0">Well, having thus wooed Miss McFlimsey and gained her,</span>

<span class="i0">I considered it only my duty to call,</span>
<span class="i2">And see if Miss Flora intended to go.</span>
<span class="i0">I found her,&mdash;as ladies are apt to be found,</span>
<span class="i0">When the time intervening between the first sound</span>
<span class="i0">Of the bell and the visitor's entry is shorter</span>
<span class="i0">Than usual,&mdash;I found; I won't say&mdash;I caught her,</span>
<span class="i0">Intent on the pier-glass, undoubtedly meaning</span>
<span class="i0">To see if perhaps it didn't need cleaning.</span>
<span class="i0">She turned as I entered,&mdash;"Why, Harry, you sinner,</span>
<span class="i0">I thought that you went to the Flashers' to dinner!"</span>
<span class="i0">"So I did," I replied; "but the dinner is swallowed</span>
<span class="i2">And digested, I trust, for 'tis now nine and more,</span>
<span class="i0">So being relieved from that duty, I followed</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Inclination, which led me, you see, to your door;</span>
<span class="i0">And now will your ladyship so condescend</span>
<span class="i0">As just to inform me if you intend</span>
<span class="i0">Your beauty and graces and presence to lend</span>
<span class="i0">(All of which, when I own, I hope no one will borrow)</span>
<span class="i0">To the <span class="smcap">Stuckups</span>, whose party, you know, is to-morrow?"</span>
<span class="i0">The fair Flora looked up with a pitiful air,</span>
<span class="i0">And answered quite promptly, "Why, Harry, <i>mon cher</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">I should like above all things to go with you there,</span>
<span class="i0">But really and truly&mdash;I've nothing to wear."</span>
<span class="i0">"Nothing to wear! go just as you are;</span>
<span class="i0">Wear the dress you have on, and you'll be by far,</span>
<span class="i0">I engage, the most bright and particular star</span>
<span class="i2">On the Stuckup horizon&mdash;" I stopped&mdash;for her eye,</span>
<span class="i0">Notwithstanding this delicate onset of flattery,</span>
<span class="i0">Opened on me at once a most terrible battery</span>
<span class="i2">Of scorn and amazement. She made no reply,</span>
<span class="i0">But gave a slight turn to the end of her nose&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">That pure Grecian feature&mdash;as much as to say,</span>
<span class="i0">"How absurd that any sane man should suppose</span>
<span class="i0">That a lady would go to a ball in the clothes,</span>
<span class="i2">No matter how fine, that she wears every day!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So I ventured again: "Wear your crimson brocade"</span>
<span class="i0">(Second turn-up of nose)&mdash;"That's too dark by a shade."</span>
<span class="i0">"Your blue silk"&mdash;"That's too heavy." "Your pink"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i8">"That's too light."</span>
<span class="i0">"Wear tulle over satin"&mdash;"I can't endure white."</span>
<span class="i0">"Your rose-colored, then, the best of the batch"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"I haven't a thread of point-lace to match."</span>
<span class="i0">"Your brown <i>moire antique</i>"&mdash;"Yes, and look like a Quaker."</span>
<span class="i0">"The pearl-colored"&mdash;"I would, but that plaguey dressmaker</span>
<span class="i0">Has had it a week." "Then that exquisite lilac</span>
<span class="i0">In which you would melt the heart of a Shylock"</span>
<span class="i0">(Here the nose took again the same elevation)&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"I wouldn't wear that for the whole of creation."</span>
<span class="i2">"Why not? It's my fancy, there's nothing could strike it</span>
<span class="i0">As more <i>comme il faut</i>"&mdash;"Yes, but, dear me! that lean</span>
<span class="i2">Sophronia Stuckup has got one just like it,</span>
<span class="i0">And I won't appear dressed like a chit of sixteen."</span>
<span class="i0">"Then that splendid purple, that sweet Mazarine,</span>
<span class="i0">That superb <i>point d'aiguille</i>, that imperial green,</span>
<span class="i0">That zephyr-like tarlatan, that rich <i>grenadine</i>"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"Not one of all which is fit to be seen,"</span>
<span class="i0">Said the lady, becoming excited and flushed.</span>
<span class="i0">"Then wear," I exclaimed, in a tone which quite crushed</span>
<span class="i2">Opposition, "that gorgeous <i>toilette</i> which you sported</span>
<span class="i0">In Paris last spring, at the grand presentation,</span>
<span class="i0">When you quite turned the head of the head of the nation;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And by all the grand court were so very much courted."</span>
<span class="i2">The end of the nose was portentously tipped up,</span>
<span class="i0">And both the bright eyes shot forth indignation,</span>
<span class="i0">As she burst upon me with the fierce exclamation,</span>
<span class="i0">"I have worn it three times at the least calculation,</span>
<span class="i2">And that and most of my dresses are ripped up!"</span>
<span class="i0">Here I <i>ripped out</i> something, perhaps rather rash,</span>
<span class="i2">Quite innocent, though; but, to use an expression</span>
<span class="i0">More striking than classic, it "settled my hash,"</span>
<span class="i2">And proved very soon the last act of our session.</span>
<span class="i0">"Fiddlesticks, is it, sir? I wonder the ceiling</span>
<span class="i0">Doesn't fall down and crush you&mdash;you men have no feeling;</span>
<span class="i0">You selfish, unnatural, illiberal creatures,</span>
<span class="i0">Who set yourselves up as patterns and preachers,</span>
<span class="i0">Your silly pretence&mdash;why, what a mere guess it is!</span>
<span class="i0">Pray, what do you know of a woman's necessities?</span>
<span class="i0">I have told you and showed you I've nothing to wear,</span>
<span class="i0">And it's perfectly plain you not only don't care,</span>
<span class="i0">But you do not believe me"&mdash;(here the nose went still higher)&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I suppose, if you dared, you would call me a liar.</span>
<span class="i0">Our engagement is ended, sir&mdash;yes, on the spot;</span>
<span class="i0">You're a brute, and a monster, and&mdash;I don't know what."</span>
<span class="i0">I mildly suggested the words&mdash;Hottentot,</span>

<span class="i0">Pickpocket, and cannibal, Tartar, and thief,</span>
<span class="i0">As gentle expletives which might give relief;</span>
<span class="i0">But this only proved as a spark to the powder,</span>
<span class="i0">And the storm I had raised came faster and louder;</span>
<span class="i0">It blew and it rained, thundered, lightened, and hailed</span>
<span class="i0">Interjections, verbs, pronouns, till language quite failed</span>
<span class="i0">To express the abusive, and then its arrears</span>
<span class="i0">Were brought up all at once by a torrent of tears,</span>
<span class="i0">And my last faint, despairing attempt at an obs-</span>
<span class="i0">Ervation was lost in a tempest of sobs.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, I felt for the lady, and felt for my hat, too,</span>
<span class="i0">Improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo,</span>
<span class="i0">In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay</span>
<span class="i0">Quite too deep for words, as Wordsworth would say;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, without going through the form of a bow,</span>
<span class="i0">Found myself in the entry&mdash;I hardly knew how,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">On doorstep and sidewalk, past lamp-post and square,</span>
<span class="i0">At home and up-stairs, in my own easy-chair;</span>
<span class="i2">Poked my feet into slippers, my fire into blaze,</span>
<span class="i0">And said to myself, as I lit my cigar,</span>
<span class="i0">"Supposing a man had the wealth of the Czar</span>
<span class="i2">Of the Russias to boot, for the rest of his days,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Since that night, taking pains that it should not be bruited</span>
<span class="i0">Abroad in society, I've instituted</span>
<span class="i0">A course of inquiry, extensive and thorough,</span>
<span class="i0">On this vital subject, and find, to my horror,</span>
<span class="i0">That the fair Flora's case is by no means surprising,</span>
<span class="i2">But that there exists the greatest distress</span>
<span class="i0">In our female community, solely arising</span>
<span class="i2">From this unsupplied destitution of dress,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose unfortunate victims are filling the air</span>
<span class="i0">With the pitiful wail of "Nothing to wear."</span>
<span class="i0">Researches in some of the "Upper Ten" districts</span>
<span class="i0">Reveal the most painful and startling statistics,</span>
<span class="i0">Of which let me mention only a few:</span>
<span class="i0">In one single house, on the Fifth Avenue,</span>
<span class="i0">Three young ladies were found, all below twenty-two,</span>
<span class="i0">Who have been three whole weeks without anything new</span>
<span class="i0">In the way of flounced silks, and thus left in the lurch</span>
<span class="i0">Are unable to go to ball, concert, or church.</span>
<span class="i0">In another large mansion, near the same place,</span>
<span class="i0">Was found a deplorable, heart-rending case</span>
<span class="i0">Of entire destitution of Brussels point-lace.</span>
<span class="i0">In a neighboring block there was found, in three calls,</span>
<span class="i0">Total want, long continued, of camel's-hair shawls;</span>
<span class="i0">And a suffering family, whose case exhibits</span>
<span class="i0">The most pressing need of real ermine tippets;</span>
<span class="i0">One deserving young lady almost unable</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To survive for the want of a new Russian sable;</span>
<span class="i0">Still another, whose tortures have been most terrific</span>
<span class="i0">Ever since the sad loss of the steamer Pacific,</span>
<span class="i0">In which were engulfed, not friend or relation</span>
<span class="i0">(For whose fate she perhaps might have found consolation,</span>
<span class="i0">Or borne it, at least, with serene resignation),</span>
<span class="i0">But the choicest assortment of French sleeves and collars</span>
<span class="i0">Ever sent out from Paris, worth thousands of dollars,</span>
<span class="i0">And all as to style most <i>recherché</i> and rare,</span>
<span class="i0">The want of which leaves her with nothing to wear,</span>
<span class="i0">And renders her life so drear and dyspeptic</span>
<span class="i0">That she's quite a recluse, and almost a sceptic;</span>
<span class="i0">For she touchingly says that this sort of grief</span>
<span class="i0">Cannot find in Religion the slightest relief,</span>
<span class="i0">And Philosophy has not a maxim to spare</span>
<span class="i0">For the victim of such overwhelming despair.</span>
<span class="i0">But the saddest by far of all these sad features</span>
<span class="i0">Is the cruelty practised upon the poor creatures</span>
<span class="i0">By husbands and fathers, real Bluebeards and Timons,</span>
<span class="i0">Who resist the most touching appeals made for diamonds</span>
<span class="i0">By their wives and their daughters, and leave them for days</span>
<span class="i0">Unsupplied with new jewelry, fans, or bouquets,</span>
<span class="i0">Even laugh at their miseries whenever they have a chance,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And deride their demands as useless extravagance.</span>
<span class="i0">One case of a bride was brought to my view,</span>
<span class="i0">Too sad for belief, but, alas! 't was too true,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose husband refused, as savage as Charon,</span>
<span class="i0">To permit her to take more than ten trunks to Sharon.</span>
<span class="i0">The consequence was, that when she got there,</span>
<span class="i0">At the end of three weeks she had nothing to wear,</span>
<span class="i0">And when she proposed to finish the season</span>
<span class="i0">At Newport, the monster refused out and out,</span>
<span class="i0">For his infamous conduct alleging no reason,</span>
<span class="i0">Except that the waters were good for his gout;</span>
<span class="i0">Such treatment as this was too shocking, of course,</span>
<span class="i0">And proceedings are now going on for divorce.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But why harrow the feelings by lifting the curtain</span>
<span class="i0">From these scenes of woe? Enough, it is certain</span>
<span class="i0">Has here been disclosed to stir up the pity</span>
<span class="i0">Of every benevolent heart in the city,</span>
<span class="i0">And spur up Humanity into a canter</span>
<span class="i0">To rush and relieve these sad cases instanter.</span>
<span class="i0">Won't somebody, moved by this touching description,</span>
<span class="i0">Come forward to-morrow and head a subscription?</span>
<span class="i0">Won't some kind philanthropist, seeing that aid is</span>
<span class="i0">So needed at once by these indigent ladies,</span>
<span class="i0">Take charge of the matter? Or won't Peter Cooper</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;</span>
<span class="i0">The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,</span>
<span class="i2">To whom the said spectacles ought to belong.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause,</span>
<span class="i2">With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning,</span>
<span class="i0">While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear</span>
<span class="i2">(And your lordship," he said, "will undoubtedly find)</span>
<span class="i0">That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,</span>
<span class="i2">Which amounts to possession, time out of mind."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,</span>
<span class="i2">"Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle.</span>
<span class="i0">As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,</span>
<span class="i2">Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Again, would your lordship a moment suppose</span>
<span class="i2">('T is a case that has happened, and may happen again)</span>
<span class="i0">That the visage or countenance had <i>not</i> a Nose,</span>
<span class="i2">Pray, who <i>would</i>, or who <i>could</i>, wear spectacles then?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"On the whole, it appears, and my argument shows,</span>
<span class="i2">With a reasoning the court will never condemn,</span>
<span class="i0">That the spectacles, plainly, were made for the Nose,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Nose was, as plainly, intended for them."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),</span>
<span class="i2">He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:</span>
<span class="i0">But what were his arguments, few people know,</span>
<span class="i2">For the court did not think them equally wise.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So his lordship decreed, with a grave, solemn tone,</span>
<span class="i2">Decisive and clear, without one <i>if</i> or <i>but</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,</span>
<span class="i2">By daylight or candlelight,&mdash;Eyes should be <i>shut</i>.</span>

<span class="i8">Even than before;</span>

<span class="i8">He hopped now about</span>
<span class="i8">With a gait devout;</span>
<span class="i0">At Matins, at Vespers, he never was out;</span>
<span class="i0">And, so far from any more pilfering deeds,</span>
<span class="i0">He always seemed telling the Confessor's beads.</span>
<span class="i0">If any one lied, or if any one swore,</span>
<span class="i0">Or slumbered in prayer-time and happened to snore,</span>
<span class="i8">That good Jackdaw</span>
<span class="i8">Would give a great "Caw!"</span>
<span class="i0">As much as to say, "Don't do so any more!"</span>
<span class="i0">While many remarked, as his manners they saw,</span>
<span class="i0">That they "never had known such a pious Jackdaw!"</span>
<span class="i8">He long lived the pride</span>
<span class="i8">Of that country side,</span>
<span class="i0">And at last in the odor of sanctity died;</span>
<span class="i8">When, as words were too faint</span>
<span class="i8">His merits to paint,</span>
<span class="i0">The Conclave determined to make him a Saint.</span>
<span class="i0">And on newly made Saints and Popes, as you know,</span>
<span class="i0">It is the custom of Rome new names to bestow,</span>
<span class="i0">So they canonized him by the name of Jem Crow!</span>

<span class="i0">Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Snuffy old drone from the German hive.</span>
<span class="i0">That was the year when Lisbon-town</span>

<span class="i0">A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn't wear <i>out</i>.</span>
<span class="i0">But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,</span>
<span class="i0">With an "I dew vum," or an "I tell <i>yeou</i>,")</span>
<span class="i0">He would build one shay to beat the taown</span>

<span class="i0">The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese,</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Respected Wife</span>: By these few lines my whereabouts thee'll learn:</span>
<span class="i0">Moreover, I impart to thee my serious concern.</span>
<span class="i0">The language of this people is a riddle unto me;</span>
<span class="i0">For words with them are figments of a reckless mockery.</span>
<span class="i0">For instance, as I left the cars, a youth with smutty face</span>
<span class="i0">Said, "Shine?" "Nay I'll not shine," I said, "except with inward grace."</span>
<span class="i0">"What's inward grace?" said this young Turk;</span>
<span class="i0">"A liquid or a paste? Hi, daddy, how does the old thing work?"</span>
<span class="i0">I then said to a jehu, whose breath suggested gin,</span>
<span class="i0">"Friend, can thee take me to a reputable inn?"</span>
<span class="i0">But this man's gross irrelevance I shall not soon forget;</span>
<span class="i0">Instead of simply Yea or Nay, he gruffly said, "You bet!"</span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, nay, I will not bet," I said, "for that would be a sin.</span>
<span class="i0">Why dost not answer plainly? can thee take me to an inn?</span>
<span class="i0">Thy vehicle is doubtless made to carry folks about in;</span>
<span class="i0">Why then prevaricate?" Said he, "Aha! well now, you're shoutin'!"</span>
<span class="i0">"I did not shout," I said, "my friend; surely my speech is mild:</span>
<span class="i0">But thine (I grieve to say it) with falsehood is defiled.</span>

<span class="i0">"On what? Till thee explain, I cannot tell," I said;</span>
<span class="i0">But he swore that something was "too thin," moreover it was "played."</span>
<span class="i0">But all his antics were surpassed in wild absurdity</span>
<span class="i0">By threats, profanely emphasized, to "put a head" on me.</span>
<span class="i0">"No son of Belial," I said, "that miracle can do."</span>
<span class="i0">With that he fell upon me with blows and curses too;</span>
<span class="i0">But failed to work that miracle, if such was his design;</span>
<span class="i0">Instead of putting on a head, he strove to smite off mine.</span>
<span class="i0">Thee knows that I profess the peaceful precepts of our sect,</span>
<span class="i0">But this man's acts worked on me to a curious effect;</span>
<span class="i0">And when he knocked my broad-brim off, and said, "How's that for high!"</span>
<span class="i0">It roused the Adam in me, and I smote him hip and thigh.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This was a signal for the crowd, for calumny broke loose;</span>
<span class="i0">They said I'd "snatched him bald-headed," and likewise "cooked his goose."</span>
<span class="i0">But yet I do affirm, that I had not pulled his hair;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor had I cooked his poultry, for he had no poultry there.</span>
<span class="i0">They called me "bully boy," though I have seen full three-score year;</span>
<span class="i0">And they said that I was "lightning when I got upon my ear."</span>
<span class="i0">And when I asked if lightning climbed its ear, and dressed in drab,</span>
<span class="i0">"You know how 'tis yourself," said one insolent young blab.</span>
<span class="i0">So I left them in disgust: plain-spoken men like me</span>

pliocene formation. This skull is the remnant, not only
of the earliest pioneer of this State, but the oldest known
human being.... The skull was found in a shaft one
hundred and fifty feet deep, two miles from Angel's, in
Calaveras County, by a miner named James Matson, who
gave it to Mr. Scribner, a merchant, and he gave it to Dr.
Jones, who sent it to the State Geological Survey....

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I reside at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James:</span>
<span class="i0">I am not up to small deceit or any sinful games;</span>
<span class="i2">And I'll tell in simple language what I know about the row</span>
<span class="i2">That broke up our Society upon the Stanislow.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But first I would remark, that 'tis not a proper plan</span>

<span class="i2">To lay for that same member for to "put a head" on him.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, nothing could be finer, or more beautiful to see,</span>
<span class="i0">Than the first six months' proceedings of that same society;</span>
<span class="i2">Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then Brown he read a paper, and he reconstructed there,</span>
<span class="i0">From those same bones, an animal that was extremely rare;</span>
<span class="i2">And Jones then asked the Chair for a suspension of the rules,</span>
<span class="i2">Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile, and said he was at fault;</span>
<span class="i0">It seemed he had been trespassing on Jones's family vault;</span>
<span class="i2">He was a most sarcastic man this quiet Mr. Brown,</span>

<span class="i2">Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Abner Dean of Angel's raised a point of order, when</span>
<span class="i0">A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen;</span>

The air of this song is my own. It was first set
to music by Heather, and most beautifully set too. It was
afterwards set by Dewar, whether with the same accompaniments
or not, I have forgot. It is my own favorite
humorous song, when forced to sing by ladies against my
will, which too frequently happens; and, notwithstanding
my wood-notes wild, it will never be sung by any so well again.

"The Vicar of Bray in Berkshire, England, was
Simon Alleyn, or Allen, who held his place from 1540 to
1588. He was a Papist under the reign of Henry the
Eighth, and a Protestant under Edward the Sixth. He was
a Papist again under Mary, and once more became a Protestant
in the reign of Elizabeth. When this scandal to
the gown was reproached for his versatility of religious
creeds, and taxed for being a turn-coat and an inconstant
changeling, as Fuller expresses it, he replied: 'Not so
neither; for if I changed my religion, I am sure I kept
true to my principle, which is to live and die the Vicar of
Bray.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Disraeli.</span>
